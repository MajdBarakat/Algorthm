**ALGORTHM** -- **https://algorthm.co.uk/**

Algorthm is an educational web-application created to visualize various algorithms with the aim of changing the traditional method of teaching algorithms and data-structures in the field of computer science. This report was written to document the issues behind the ways of teaching a core subject in computing as well as propose a possible solution.

**HOW TO USE:**

-Navigate to the settings tab on the right side of the window.
-Select a maze generating algorithm.
-Select a pathfinding algorithm.
-Set the positions of the start and end nodes.
-Using the top bar, you can now randomly generate a maze and find the path between the nodes.

**FEATURES**

- FOUR maze generating algorithms
    -Random
    -Prim's Algorithm
    -Recursive Backtracking
    -Reverse Recursive Backtracking
    
- THREE pathfinding algorithms
    - Depth First Search (DFS)
    - Dijkstra's Algorthm
    - A Star Search (currently getting reworked)

- THREE intervals of speed for generating mazes and paths
- Grid size can be changed in the grid tab
- Color schemes can be changed to accomodate for color blindness
- Algorithms' pseudocode can be viewed from the right tab on executing a maze generating or pathfinding algorithm.

**UPCOMING FEATURES**

- NEW pathfinding algorithms
- NEW maze generating algorithms
- Control exact value speed
- Create custom color schemes
- A timeline, where the user can rewind, pause, or change speed of the algorithm
- The exact line of pseudocode will be highlighted upon execution in the timeline
